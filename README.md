I'm thrilled to share my submission for the Codebasics Banking Domain Resume Challenge Project #8: 

💳The project is focused on expanding Mitron Bank's product offerings, specifically introducing a new line of credit cards.

 ➡ Problem Statement
📊 We have to analyze the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. 

🎯 The objective is to strategically tailor these credit cards to meet the diverse needs and preferences of the customer base while aligning with market trends and opportunities. 

👉 The analysis delves into:
Demographic classification: Classifying the customers based on available demography such as age group, gender, occupation etc. and provide insights based on them. 

↗ Key Metric
Avg income utilization %: Finding the average income utilization % of customers (avg_spends/avg_income). The higher the average income utilization %, the more is their likelihood to use credit cards. 

➡ Spending Insights: Where do people spend money the most? Does it have any impact due to occupation, gender, city, age etc.? This can help us to add relevant credit card features for specific target groups. 

➡ Key Customer Segments: By doing above, we should be able to identify and profile key customer segments that are likely to be the highest-value users of the new credit cards. 

🔆 Credit Card Feature Recommendations: Providing recommendations on what key features should be included in the credit card which will improve the likelihood of credit card usage.
